## Unix History

* Shell Scripting was developed in the context of the UNIX Operating System from Bell Labs

* Early UNIX systems packed incredible power into very small machines
  * 64 Kb "virtual" address space for the code and for data
  * This was often less than that of physical memory on the early [PDP-11S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11)
* Source Code made it easy to experiment and change the system
* AT&T Bell Labs heavily influenced Unix by the likes of [Ken Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson), [Dennis Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie), and others

Quote from Dennis Ritchie for Vision of Unix:

> What we wanted to preserve was not just a good environment in which to do programming, but a system around which a fellowship could form. We knew from experience that the essence of communal computing, as supplied by remote-access, time-shared machines, is not just to type programs into a terminal instead of a keypunch, but to encourage close communication.

* Unix Developers were the users of the system and they developed tools to solve their own problems
* Unix Developers were given freedom to experiment and rewrite Unix as needed
* Unix was designed in a quest for elegance

## Unix Software Philosophy

[Software Tools Book](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Tools-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/020103669X) and [Software Tools in Pascal](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Tools-Pascal-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0201103427/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_img_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=2HVC5MB1PKHC4YCETHP9&dpID=41eyH0p9aiL&preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=detail)

* Programs should be like specialized tools in a carpenter's toolbox
  * Avoid `create programs to rule them all`
  * Don't create programs that are like a Swiss Army Knife
      * Meaning they do too much
  * Tools can be combined using pipelines and the shell to get your work done
  * This philosophy became populare in [Kernighan & Plauger Books](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Tools-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/020103669X)

  #### Do One thing Well

  Programs are easier to:

  1. Write and to correct

  2. Document

  3. Understand and use

  The `cat` command originally only concatenated files

  The `cp` command copies files

  The `mv` command moves and renames files

#### Process Lines of Text

Using Text as the main data format has advantages:

* Text is easy to process with existing and new tools

* Text can be edited with any text editor

* Text is portable across networks and machine architectures

For example to list some popular baby names and sort them:

```bash
cat data/top-10-baby-names-2016.txt | awk '{print $2 }' | sort
```

#### Use Regular Expressions

* Regular Expressions provide powerful text matching and substitution

2 Flavors of regular expressions standardized by [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX)

1. Basic Regular Expressions (BREs)
  1. grep, sed, ...
2. Extended Regular Expressions (EREs)
  1. egrep, awk, ...

#### Default to Standard Input/Output

Use Standard Input/Output (I/O) when there is no files on the command line:

* Helps simplify writing programs
* Helps you hook programs together with pipelines
* Helps encourage programs to do one thing well

#### Don't Be Chatty

* Status messages that are mixed with standard output confuse programs downstream
* If you ask then you get it. Don't prompt with 'Are you sure'
* Do know what you are doing:
  * `rm -rf /` Before running a command like this
  * This will delete everything starting from the root directory
* We have version control systems such as `Git` use them

#### Make sure to use the input format for output

* If your text is structured then after processing
  * Write the same format for standard output in the same format of standard input
  * Doing this affords you to build specialized tools that work together

#### Write specialized tools if they do not exist

* At times a tool does not exist, that is when you need to write the tool
  * Can the tool be useful to other people?
  * Can the tool be generalized?

If any of the answers to these questions are yes:
  * then write a general purpose tool

* Scripting languages can often be used to write a software tool:
  * Awk
  * Perl
  * Python
  * Ruby
  * Shell

* You can also use other languages like for example `Golang` as we will see

#### Software Tools Summary

* Using the `software tools` approach helps provide a framework and a mindset for programming and scripting
* You can combine software tools to solve software problems
  * This strategy in turn gives you flexibility and helps promote innovation
* Know your tools and thinking in the `Software Tools` Philosophy will improve your scripting

## Self Contained Shell Scripts

[Executable Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable)

> In computing, executable code or an executable file or executable program, sometimes simply referred to as an executable or binary, causes a computer "to perform indicated tasks according to encoded instructions,"[1] as opposed to a data file that must be parsed by a program to be meaningful.

Typically a high level language is used that compiles to executable machine code files

* Executable scripts typically start with a `Shebang` => `#! /bin/bash` or the like
  * An optional argument can be provided
  * Some Unix systems have small limits on the path name length

Shell Scripts can be simple executable text files that contain shell commands.

* Keep in mind that this only works if the shell script is in the same language as the interactive shell
  * For example to expect a zsh shell script to run in a bash environment
